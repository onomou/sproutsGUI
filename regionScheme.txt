Circuit scan region

Leftmost point = x0
Rightmost point = x1
Highest point = y0
Lowest point = y1

For x from x0 to x1 step
	Draw line from (x,y0) to (x,y1)
		If intersects current curve (or another curve bounding the region)
			Flip state
		If state is active (inside the region)
			If intersects another node (node then inside region)
				Add node to list (find associated graph)

Find region boundary (right-hand rule)
Start at a point
Pick a direction
	Get incident vectors of point (for Bezier, vector from endpoint to its control point)
	Compute angle between each incident vector and the chosen direction (try dot product : (v dot u)/(norm(v)norm(u)) = cos t)
	Pick smallest angle left of incident vector
	Choose the line that has that angle scalar vector control point (please, for pity's sake, revise this sentence)
	Do it all again until returning to start point
